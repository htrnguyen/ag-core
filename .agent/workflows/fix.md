# Fix Workflow

1.  **Analyze Context**
    - Read the file(s) mentioned by the user.
    - Read `.agent/rules/antigravity_standards.md` to ensure compliance.

2.  **Identify Issue**
    - Determine the root cause of the bug or problem.
    - Check for violations of:
        - Security standards (`.agent/rules/security.md`)
        - Coding standards (`.agent/rules/coding_standards.md`)

3.  **Apply Fix**
    - Use `basic_code_modification` skill if needed.
    - Modify the code to resolve the issue while adhering to standards.

4.  **Verify**
    - Ensure no new issues are introduced.
    - Run relevant tests if available.
