# Plan Workflow

1.  **Requirements Analysis**
    - Understand the user's goal.
    - Check `.agent/rules/tech_stack.md` for approved technologies.

2.  **Design Solution**
    - Outline the architecture.
    - Identify required changes (Files, Database, API).
    - Ensure compliance with `.agent/rules/ai_governance.md`.

3.  **Generate Plan**
    - Create a step-by-step implementation plan.
    - Save as `implementation_plan.md` (or similar artifact).
