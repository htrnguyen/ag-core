# Plan Workflow

1.  **Context & Complexity Assessment**
    - **Determine Scale**: Is this a simple fix, a feature, or a major architectural change?
    - **Tailor Process**:
        - _Simple_: Skip formal architecture doc; go straight to implementation steps.
        - _Complex_: Strict adherence to all design & compliance checks.

2.  **Requirements Analysis**
    - Understand the user's goal.
    - Check `.agent/rules/tech_stack.md` for approved technologies.

3.  **Design Solution**
    - Outline the architecture.
    - Identify required changes (Files, Database, API).
    - Ensure compliance with `.agent/rules/ai_governance.md`.

4.  **Generate Plan**
    - Create a step-by-step implementation plan.
    - Save as `implementation_plan.md` (or similar artifact).
